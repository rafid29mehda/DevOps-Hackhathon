**Use Case Scenario: Secure CI/CD Pipeline with Container Image Scanning**

In this DevOps Hackathon scenario, participants will focus on enhancing the security of a CI/CD pipeline by integrating container image scanning. The challenge revolves around a microservices architecture using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS. The specific microservice for this scenario is "UserAuthenticator."

**Problem Statement:**

As security is a top concern, your task is to implement a secure CI/CD pipeline for the "UserAuthenticator" microservice. This involves integrating container image scanning to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in the Docker images before deployment.

**Requirements:**
1. Containerize the "UserAuthenticator" microservice using Docker.
2. Integrate a container image scanning tool into the CI/CD pipeline.
3. Implement a process to fail the pipeline if critical vulnerabilities are detected.
4. Utilize AWS services for secure storage and deployment of container images.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Containerize "UserAuthenticator" with Docker:**
   - Create a Dockerfile for the "UserAuthenticator" specifying dependencies and security best practices.
   - Build a Docker image for the microservice.
   - Push the Docker image to a secure container registry, such as AWS ECR.

2. **Integrate Container Image Scanning:**
   - Choose a container image scanning tool (e.g., Clair, Trivy).
   - Integrate the scanning tool into the CI/CD pipeline after the build stage.
   - Configure the scanning tool to analyze the Docker image for vulnerabilities.

3. **Implement Failures for Critical Vulnerabilities:**
   - Set up a policy in the CI/CD pipeline to fail the build if critical vulnerabilities are found.
   - Define the severity levels for vulnerabilities that should trigger a pipeline failure.
   - Ensure the pipeline stops at the scanning stage if critical issues are identified.

4. **AWS Secure Storage and Deployment:**
   - Store the Docker image securely in AWS ECR.
   - Implement AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles with the principle of least privilege for pipeline access.
   - Configure AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for deploying the "UserAuthenticator" microservice securely.

**Example in Easy Terms:**

Imagine preparing a gift box with a surprise inside:
1. **Containerize like preparing the gift:** You carefully place the surprise inside a box, ensuring it's secure and well-presented.
2. **Integrate scanning like checking the gift for surprises:** Before gifting, you scan the box to make sure there's nothing harmful inside. Similarly, in CI/CD, you scan the Docker image to ensure there are no vulnerabilities.
3. **Failures for Critical Vulnerabilities like returning a dangerous gift:** If you find something harmful, you don't gift it. In CI/CD, if critical vulnerabilities are detected, the pipeline stops to prevent deploying a risky microservice.
4. **AWS Secure Storage and Deployment like safekeeping the gift and delivering securely:** You securely store the gift, ensuring only the right person can access it. In AWS, you store the Docker image in ECR and deploy the microservice securely using IAM and EKS.
