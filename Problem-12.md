**Use Case Scenario: Hybrid Cloud Deployment with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS EKS**

In this DevOps Hackathon scenario, participants will focus on deploying a hybrid cloud application using Docker containers, Kubernetes, and AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The challenge is to ensure seamless integration between on-premises infrastructure and AWS for the "InventoryManagement" microservice.

**Problem Statement:**

The "InventoryManagement" microservice is a crucial component of an inventory system. Your task is to design and implement a hybrid cloud deployment, leveraging Docker containers, Kubernetes for orchestration, and AWS EKS to seamlessly manage the "InventoryManagement" microservice across on-premises servers and the AWS cloud.

**Requirements:**
1. Containerize the "InventoryManagement" microservice using Docker.
2. Set up Kubernetes clusters on on-premises servers and AWS EKS.
3. Deploy the microservice using Kubernetes across the hybrid cloud environment.
4. Implement networking configurations for secure communication and data synchronization between on-premises and AWS.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Containerize "InventoryManagement" with Docker:**
   - Develop a Dockerfile for the "InventoryManagement" microservice, encapsulating its dependencies.
   - Build a Docker image for the microservice and store it in a container registry.

2. **Set Up Kubernetes Clusters:**
   - Deploy a Kubernetes cluster on on-premises servers using tools like kubeadm or a supported platform like Rancher.
   - Create an AWS EKS cluster using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

3. **Deploy Microservice Across Hybrid Cloud:**
   - Deploy the "InventoryManagement" microservice using Kubernetes manifests across both on-premises and AWS EKS clusters.
   - Utilize Kubernetes Federation or similar tools for managing configurations and deployments across clusters.
   - Set up proper resource limits and requests to ensure optimal performance in both environments.

4. **Implement Networking Configurations for Secure Communication:**
   - Set up a secure VPN or Direct Connect connection between on-premises and AWS for private communication.
   - Configure Kubernetes ServiceTypes or Ingress resources to route traffic securely between clusters.
   - Implement data synchronization mechanisms for consistent data across on-premises and AWS.

**Example in Easy Terms:**

Think of hybrid cloud deployment with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS EKS like managing a global chain of stores:
1. **Containerize like preparing products for shipment:** You package products (microservice) in standardized boxes (Docker containers) for shipment.
2. **Set Up Kubernetes Clusters like establishing stores in different cities:** You establish stores (Kubernetes clusters) in different cities, some on-premises and some in the AWS cloud.
3. **Deploy Microservice Across Hybrid Cloud like stocking products in stores:** You stock products (microservice) in each store (cluster) based on demand, ensuring products are available everywhere.
4. **Implement Networking Configurations like connecting stores securely:** You connect all stores (clusters) with secure communication channels (VPN), ensuring products move seamlessly between them.
