**Use Case Scenario: Disaster Recovery Plan for Multi-Region Deployment in AWS**

In this DevOps Hackathon scenario, participants will address the challenge of ensuring high availability and resilience for a distributed microservices architecture. The focus is on implementing a disaster recovery plan for the "CustomerPortal" microservice, deployed across multiple AWS regions.

**Problem Statement:**

The "CustomerPortal" microservice is a critical component for user authentication and account management. Your task is to create a disaster recovery plan to ensure minimal downtime and data loss in the event of a regional failure.

**Requirements:**
1. Deploy the "CustomerPortal" microservice in at least two AWS regions.
2. Set up data replication mechanisms for maintaining consistency across regions.
3. Implement an automated failover mechanism to redirect traffic in case of a regional failure.
4. Create a detailed disaster recovery runbook for the operations team.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Multi-Region Deployment:**
   - Use AWS services like Amazon EC2, RDS, or ECS to deploy the "CustomerPortal" microservice in at least two AWS regions.
   - Configure Amazon Route 53 with a latency-based routing policy to distribute traffic based on the proximity of users to each region.

2. **Data Replication for Consistency:**
   - Choose a data replication strategy based on the data storage used (e.g., RDS Multi-AZ, DynamoDB Global Tables).
   - Ensure that data modifications in one region are replicated to other regions to maintain consistency.

3. **Automated Failover Mechanism:**
   - Set up health checks and alarms using AWS CloudWatch to monitor the health of the "CustomerPortal" in each region.
   - Implement AWS Global Accelerator or a load balancer to automatically redirect traffic to a healthy region in case of a regional failure.
   - Test the failover mechanism regularly to ensure its effectiveness.

4. **Disaster Recovery Runbook:**
   - Document detailed steps for the operations team to follow in the event of a regional failure.
   - Include information on how to trigger failover manually if needed.
   - Provide contact details and escalation paths for key personnel involved in disaster recovery.
   - Regularly review and update the runbook based on changes in the architecture or lessons learned from simulations.

**Example in Easy Terms:**

Think of disaster recovery like planning for unexpected weather during an outdoor event:
1. **Multi-Region Deployment like having events in different cities:** Instead of hosting all events in one city (region), you organize events in different cities (AWS regions).
2. **Data Replication like sharing event updates:** You ensure everyone is on the same page by sharing updates about the event (data) across all cities (regions).
3. **Automated Failover Mechanism like having backup venues:** If weather becomes a problem in one city (region), you automatically move the event to a backup venue (healthy region) without disrupting the overall plan.
4. **Disaster Recovery Runbook like a detailed event plan:** You create a detailed plan with contact details, alternative arrangements, and steps to follow if things don't go as planned (disaster recovery runbook).
