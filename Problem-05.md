**Use Case Scenario: Monitoring and Logging for Microservices with Prometheus and Grafana**

In this DevOps Hackathon scenario, participants will focus on implementing robust monitoring and logging for a microservices architecture using Prometheus and Grafana. The challenge is to ensure visibility into the performance and health of the "InventoryService."

**Problem Statement:**

The "InventoryService" microservice is critical for tracking product inventory. Your task is to set up monitoring and logging to detect issues, analyze performance, and troubleshoot problems in real-time using Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization.

**Requirements:**
1. Instrument the "InventoryService" microservice with Prometheus metrics.
2. Deploy Prometheus for collecting and storing metrics from the microservice.
3. Set up Grafana for visualizing and alerting based on Prometheus metrics.
4. Implement logging with Grafana Loki for efficient log analysis.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Instrument "InventoryService" with Prometheus Metrics:**
   - Add Prometheus client libraries to the "InventoryService" code to expose relevant metrics.
   - Define custom metrics such as request latency, error rates, and resource usage.
   - Ensure the metrics endpoint is accessible for Prometheus scraping.

2. **Deploy Prometheus for Metrics Collection:**
   - Set up a Prometheus server in your environment or use a managed Prometheus service.
   - Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the "InventoryService" at regular intervals.
   - Define alerting rules for critical metrics to trigger notifications.

3. **Set Up Grafana for Visualization:**
   - Install and configure Grafana to connect to the Prometheus server.
   - Create dashboards in Grafana to visualize key metrics from the "InventoryService."
   - Set up alerting in Grafana to notify when certain conditions are met.

4. **Implement Logging with Grafana Loki:**
   - Deploy Grafana Loki for log storage and indexing.
   - Configure the "InventoryService" to send logs to Loki.
   - Create queries and explore logs using Grafana Loki interface for efficient troubleshooting.

**Example in Easy Terms:**

Imagine monitoring and logging like supervising a cooking class:
1. **Instrument with Prometheus Metrics like tracking ingredients:** Each student (microservice) keeps track of how much flour, sugar, and other ingredients (metrics) they use during cooking (processing requests).
2. **Deploy Prometheus like having a class assistant:** The assistant (Prometheus) regularly checks how students (microservices) are doing, noting their progress and any issues.
3. **Set Up Grafana for Visualization like having a recipe book:** You organize the information from the class assistant (Prometheus) into a recipe book (Grafana dashboards) that helps you quickly see how each student is performing.
4. **Implement Logging with Grafana Loki like taking notes during class:** As the class progresses, you take notes (logs) about what each student does. If something goes wrong, you can refer to these notes for quick troubleshooting.
